Feature: Admin edit the text in nevgation 
    As an administrator,
    I want to be able to change the word style (font, bullet point) of text in navigation bar,
    So that I can make the content nicer and more readable.
    
    Background: Admin already login
      Given the default layout exist
      And I login as an admin
      And the following texts exist:
        | id  | title            | body                                           |
        | 1   | Mission          | designed to help dog lovers                    |
        | 2   | Background       | the first species to be domesticated by humans |
        | 3   | Goals            | improve how companion puppies are produced     |
        | 4   | How you can help | contribute to our website                      |
