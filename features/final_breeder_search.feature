  Scenario: searching for a breeder with only city and state
    When I enter "", "Waco", "TX" into breeder search
    Then I should see "George W. Bush"

  Scenario: search for a breeder with only state
    When I enter "", "", "CA" into breeder search
    Then I should see all of:
      | name            |
      | George Michael  |
      | Alex            |
      | Chris           |
      | Carl            |
